# Shell & Python Scripting Practice

This repository contains shell script and Python script files created as part of my practice in shell scripting and Python programming.

## Overview

This repo will be continuously updated with scripts focusing on:

- **Shell Scripting**: Covering topics such as **automation**, **system administration**, and **command-line utilities**.
- **Python Scripting**: Focusing on **automating tasks**, **working with files**, and more **advanced scripting concepts**.

### Focus Areas:

- Automation: Automate repetitive tasks, system monitoring, and backups.
- System Administration: Handle file management, process monitoring, and user interaction.
- Command-Line Utilities: Work with command-line arguments, system commands, and utilities to manipulate data and files.
- File Operations: Read from, write to, and manipulate files, counting lines, words, and characters.
- Control Structures: Practice if-else, for, while, and case constructs to manage flow control effectively.
- Text Processing: Work with string manipulation, regular expressions, and formatted output.
- Basic Error Handling: Handle invalid input, file existence checks, and command success/failure.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `shell/`: Contains all shell script files (`.sh`).
- `python/`: Contains all Python script files (`.py`).

## How to Use

### Shell Scripts
1. Navigate to the `shell/` directory.
2. Make sure the script has executable permissions:
   chmod +x script_name.sh
4. Run the script:
   ./script_name.sh

### Python Scripts
1. Navigate to the `python/` directory.
2. Run the Python script:
   python3 script_name.py
